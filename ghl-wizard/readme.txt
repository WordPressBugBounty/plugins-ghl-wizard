This plugin will connect the popular CRM LeadConnector to the most popular content management software, WordPress. It will elevate your automation experience to the next level. including memberships, content protection, custom field integration and automate WooCommerce.

== 🚀 Key Features ==

== 🔗 Subaccount Connection ==
Seamlessly connect your WordPress site to your subaccount. This essential first step unlocks the full potential of the plugin's automation capabilities.

== ⚙️ Custom Values ==
Custom values are great for storing your subaccount or website variables. Use your subaccount custom values inside WordPress with this simple shortcode: `[lcw_custom_value key="your_custom_value_key"]`

== 🔒 Smart Content Protection ==
Implement tag-based access control on WordPress pages, allowing you to differentiate between paid and free users for content visibility.

== 🛒 WooCommerce Integration ==
When someone purchases a product from WooCommerce:

* That user will be added (if not exists) to your subaccount as a contact
* You can apply one or more tags to that contact if that customer purchases a specific product
* You can set specific tags for specific products
* You can add that customer directly to a specific workflow in your CRM

== 👥 Automate WordPress User Creation ==
Create WordPress users directly from your workflow. There are a few powerful use cases:

* Let someone purchase anything from your funnel, run a workflow with that purchase trigger, and send a webhook to your WordPress website. A new WordPress user will be created for that customer.
* If someone books an appointment, you can create a WordPress user for that contact.
* Based on any possible conditions, you can send a webhook to WordPress to create a WordPress user.

== 📋 Display only protected posts/pages in a post grid ==
If you protect your pages by tags, those protected pages can only be displayed in a post grid using the shortcode `[lcw_post_grid post_type="page"]`. Feel free to check the full documentation <a href="https://better-wizard.gitbook.io/lead-connector-wizard/shortcodes/lcw-post-grid" target="_blank">here</a>.

== 🔄 Redirect Customers ==
Redirect your customers to another page. You can display a message before the redirection.
Example: `[lcw_redirect url="/thank-you" delay="5" target="_self"]
    Please wait 5 seconds... redirecting.
[/lcw_redirect]`

== 🔑 Reset Password ==
Customers can reset their password with this simple password reset shortcode: `[lcw_reset_password]`. This shortcode allows you to:

* Change password
* Redirect to a page after the password is changed
* Apply or remove a tag for that user upon password change

== 🔐 Display Contact fields/ Custom fields in WordPress ==
It's true, you can display any custom fields inside WordPress from your CRM.
It'll help you create a personalized customer dashboard, show customer-centric data to your logged-in customers. By the shortcode `[lcw_contact_field]`.
Example: `[lcw_contact_field key='email']`, this will display the contact email address.
More Example: `[lcw_contact_field key='next_billing_date']` here you need to get the key from `{{contact.next_billing_date}}`, where the next_billing_date is a custom field.

== 🔐 Display content based on access ==
You can display a text/ image/ video or a block of content based on access by the shortcode `[lcw_has_any_tags]`

```
You can do the similar things by the membership with this shortcode `[lcw_has_any_memberships]`
